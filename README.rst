``region_profiler`` - profile custom regions of code
========================================================


:Synopsis: Profile user-defined regions of code without
           any external tools. Explicitly defined regions
           are specified by name in runtime, and they can
           span from a whole function call to a single
           statement to single iteration inside a loop.
